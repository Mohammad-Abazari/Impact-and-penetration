  abstract = {Ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) is a new class of concrete developed in France in the 1990s with superior characteristics including high workability, high compressive strength, increased ductility, and high resistance to environmental attacks. UHPC is increasingly used in local and international construction markets in the construction of high rise structures, long-span precast/prestressed bridge girders, marine, aviation, and defense construction applications due to its superior mechanical properties, and favorable long-term performance. This study presents recent research findings regarding the UHPC mix designs, fresh and hardened concrete properties, and current UHPC applications in the construction industry including specific bridge applications. Despite of UHPC advantages, multiple impediments are present that delays the widespread of UHPC application in the construction industry including lack of design codes and specifications for estimating UHPC performance, the need for special batching, mixing, and curing. This study assists different construction stakeholders in understanding the unique characteristics, advantages, and impediments to the widespread of UHPC applications. The deciphering of UHPC will help increase its overall market share in local and global construction markets.},
